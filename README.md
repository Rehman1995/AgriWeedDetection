## 🚀 Overview

This research addresses the challenge of weed identification in agriculture using drone-based imagery and a customized deep learning model. Our approach introduces:

- Modified backbone, neck, and head architecture
- **Ghost Convolution**, **BottleNeckCSP**, and **Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)** layers
- A purpose-built dataset for training and evaluation

These enhancements significantly improve weed detection performance in real-time agricultural environments. The model outperforms baseline architectures like YOLOv10 and RT-DETR.
